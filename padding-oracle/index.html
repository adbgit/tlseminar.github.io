<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p><a href="/https://tlseminar.github.io/first-few-milliseconds/">Last week</a>, we
examined how the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol provides a
private channel between two devices by following the handshake and
record layers protocols. The handshake layer establishes a symmetric
key that both the client and the server could use in the record layer
to encrypt and decrypt messages.</p>

<p>This week, we&rsquo;ll discuss a real-world TLS attack, the Padding Oracle
Attack, that takes advantage of our need for each message to be a
particular set length. If the original message is not long enough,
then we have to add padding for the <a href="https://tlseminar.github.io/docs/analysisssl3.pdf">CBC Mode
Encryption</a> to
work. Because the padding is present, an attacker can chip away
information on the
<a href="https://tlseminar.github.io/docs/beast.pdf">ciphertext</a>, one byte at
a time, through analyzing the receiver’s error messages for the
sender, <a href="http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/TLStiming.pdf">response time</a>,
and general behavior.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll start out by learning about how <a href="https://tlseminar.github.io/docs/analysisssl3.pdf">CBC Mode
Encryption</a> works.</p>

<h1 id="padding-and-cbc-mode">Padding and CBC Mode</h1>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://tlseminar.github.io/docs/analysisssl3.pdf"><em>Analysis of the SSL 3.0 Protocol</em></a> by David Wagner and Bruce Schneider (1997)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When AES-128 encryption is performed in cipher block chaining mode
(CBC mode), the plaintext message is first split up into 16-byte
(128-bit) blocks. It is often the case, however, that the length of
the message is not perfectly divisible by 16. To account for varying
message sizes, extra bytes, called padding, are concatenated after the
end of the message to fill up the remaining quota for the final block.</p>

<p>These bytes are not chosen at random, however, and different cipher
modes prescribe different padding methods. In order to clearly mark
for the recipient where the message ends and the padding begins, the
padding follows a strict formatting pattern. With PKCS #5 padding as
used in TLS, if there are <em>n</em> bytes of padding, then each padding byte
contains the value <em>n</em>. For instance, if the last block contains 15
message bytes, the 1-byte padding contains <code>0x01</code>; if the last block
contains 14 message bytes, the 2-byte padding contains <code>0x0202</code>;
3-byte padding contains <code>0x030303</code>; and so on.</p>

</center></p>

<p>In CBC mode, the bytes of each plaintext block n are first XOR’ed with
the encrypted bytes of the block before it, and their result is then
encrypted. Block 1 is the obvious exception, which is XOR’ed with a
fixed, random, or secret initialization vector (IV). Thus, for any
block <em>n</em> &gt; 1, where E<sub><em>k</em></sub> is the encryption function,
<em>c</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> is the encrypted block <em>n</em>, <em>p</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> is the plaintext
block <em>n</em>, and <em>c</em><sub><em>n</em>-1</sub> is the encrypted block <em>n</em>-1:
<center>
<em>c</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> = E<sub><em>k</em></sub> (<em>p</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>⊕ <em>c</em><sub><em>n</em>-1</sub>)
</center></p>

<p><center><img src="/images/paddingoracle/cbc.png" alt="cbc-mode" /><br>

</center></p>

<p>However, the predictability of the padding format can turn out to be
an extremely exploitable weakness for an active attacker. Under
SSL/TLS protocol, when servers receive an encrypted message, their
first step upon decryption is to check the validity of the padding;
that is, determine if the numbers at the end of the last block
represent the number of padding bytes. As soon as this step is
completed, the server will return to the sender either an error code
or an acknowledgment that the padding is valid. In this way, the
server acts as an oracle to an active attacker, providing them with
confirmations/rejections to inform their guesses.</p>

<h1 id="padding-oracle-attack">Padding Oracle Attack</h1>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/archive/2002/EUROCRYPT/2850/2850.pdf"><em>Security Flaws Induced by CBC Padding Applications to SSL, ISPEC, WTLS&hellip;</em></a> by Serge Vaudenay</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To begin, the attacker creates a Last Word Oracle. This first assumes
a 1-byte padding, so the format that the oracle would return as valid
is <code>0x01</code> XOR’ed with some particular value in the corresponding last
position in the <em>n</em>-1th block. Since the last byte, or word, can have
256 distinct values, the attacker can simply manipulate the <em>n</em>-1th
block, easily testing all values, until either the possibilities are
exhausted or the padding is returned as valid. If the possibilities
are exhausted, then the attacker instead tries <code>0x02</code>, then <code>0x03</code>,
and on until the padding returned is valid.</p>

<p><center><img src="/images/paddingoracle/last-word.png" alt="LastWordOracle" /><br>
<span class="caption"><em>Source: </em><a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/writable/presentations/file_upload/asec-403.pdf">Brian Holyfield, Gotham Digital Science</a></span>
</center></p>

<p>Once the attacker has learned the padding, a Block Decryption Oracle
is constructed, using the values of the encrypted <em>n</em>-1th block to,
byte by byte, guess the preceding byte, using the oracle’s pass/fail
responses to confirm correct guesses. This method is then extended to
decrypt all other blocks, as it is called on pairs containing a random
block and a ciphertext block. (Again, the logical exception is the
first block, assuming an independent initialization vector.) This is a
terrifyingly efficient attack; to implement it, the attacker only
needs (<em>b</em> * <em>W</em> * <em>N</em>)/2 trials, where <em>b</em> is the number of bytes per block,
<em>W</em> is the number of possible bytes, and <em>N</em> is the number of blocks.</p>

<p>With the CBC Padding now added to the original ciphered message,
attackers can alter this new message with blockwise operations in
order to draw information out of the originally unreadable
ciphertext. This information could potentially end up being
authentication tokens, such as cookies, granting attackers personally
identifiable information or the potential to hijack previous sessions.</p>

<h1 id="beast-plaintext-attacks-against-ssl">BEAST: Plaintext Attacks Against SSL</h1>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://tlseminar.github.io/docs/beast.pdf"><em>Here Come The \(\oplus\) Ninjas</em></a> by Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo (2011)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In CBC block encryption, each plaintext block is XORed with the
ciphertext of the previous block before being encrypted. An attempted
guess at a plaintext block can be evaluated by encrypting the
ciphertext prior to the block in question XORed with the ciphertext
prior to the current block XORed with the guess; if the new ciphertext
matches that of the block in question, then the guess is
correct:
<center>
C<sub><em>j</em></sub> = E<sub><em>k</em></sub>(P<sub><em>j</em></sub> ⊕ C<sub><em>j</em>-1</sub>), so, C<sub><em>i</em></sub>==C<sub><em>j</em></sub> iff P<sub><em>i</em></sub> == P<sub><em>j</em></sub> ⊕ C<sub><em>i</em>-1</sub> ⊕ C<sub><em>j</em>-1</sub>
</center></p>

<p>Guess G can be evaluated as equal to or unequal to plaintext
P<sub>j</sub> by setting P<sub><em>i</em></sub>=G ⊕ C<sub><em>i</em>-1</sub> ⊕
C<sub><em>j</em>-1</sub> and checking whether or not C<sub><em>j</em></sub> ==
C<sub><em>i</em></sub>. An attacker would need to be able to view the
encrypted messages and query the underlying CBC encryption system to
be able to mount an attack based on this exploit.</p>

<p>Cryptographic systems are limited in their size and ability to store
large plaintext messages, for this reason, most cryptographic systems
encrypt messages block by block as they are sent. In the case where an
attacker can append padding to a message before it is encrypted, an
attacker can mount a blockwise chosen-boundary attack, in which the
first byte of an unknown message is isolated by padding, enabling the
attacker to guess at single bytes of a message rather than block-sized
chunks.</p>

<p>The natural extension of this is to repeat the process such that once
a byte of message has been guessed by the attacker, the padding is
changed such that a single unknown byte of message is encrypted with
padding and bytes known to the attacker, allowing them to continue
guessing at single bytes of information.</p>

<p>Duong and Rizzo go on to describe the process whereby this attack
could be mounted on HTTPS to obtain a user’s HTTP cookie. The attack
only requires that an attacker can view encrypted messages, can cause
the client to make arbitrary encrypted requests, and that arbitrary
plaintext can be added to out-going requests. In the described attack,
the user is made to request a package with a padded end such that the
first byte of unknown information in the request is isolated in an
encryption with only public information. The attacker then makes
guesses at that byte of information, appending plaintext to the
request and watching the encrypted channel for a message block that
matches the block containing the unknown byte of information. At that
point, the guess that resulted in that message block is identified as
the correct guess. The process is then repeated with a smaller padding
until the user’s request header (including their HTTPS cookies) is
revealed to the attacker.</p>

<p><center><img src="/images/paddingoracle/beast.png" alt="beast" /><br>
<span class="caption"><em>Figure: </em>Attacker (Mallory) is able to sniff encrypted traffic, force Alice to send cookie-bearing HTTP requests, and insert forged plaintexts in the conversation.</span>
</center></p>

<p>There are a few issues mentioned associated with this attack, but by
using one of a variety of plugins, an attacker could make the user
open bi-directional communication with the server. On this
communication channel, the privileges required by the attacker to
mount the attack would be easier to gain.</p>

<h1 id="lucky-13-plaintext-recovery-from-injected-ciphertext">Lucky 13: Plaintext Recovery from Injected Ciphertext</h1>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/TLStiming.pdf"><em>Lucky Thirteen: Breaking the TLS and DTLS Record Protocols</em></a> by Nadhem J. Alfardan and Kenneth G. Paterson (2013)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similar in the vein of the BEAST attack using bitwise XOR operations
to glean useful plaintext information, Lucky Thirteen offers yet
another alternative means to get partial or even full plaintext
recovery with just a simple man-in-the-middle injecting ciphertext
into the original ciphertext. Based on analyzing how TLS and DTLS
decrypt a given ciphertext, these attacks also rely on CBC-mode
weaknesses.</p>

<p>The Lucky 13 attack relies on a timing channel introduced by the
difference in processing time between TLS records with correct and
incorrect padding, requiring only a standard in-the-middle attacker
for execution and providing recovered plaintext in the most severe
case.  This would indicate a major security flaw, even in comparison
to the aforementioned BEAST attack. BEAST required capabilities beyond
simple MITM on the part of the attacker.  As a result, the authors of
the paper disclosed their results to all major vendors to allow for
patching before publishing.</p>

<p>The name “Lucky 13” is a reference to a specific breakpoint in the
size of the padding on a given message.  Both TLS and DTLS use the
HMAC algorithm to compute MAC tags for messages.  HMAC operates using
a compression function on messages with lengths equal to multiples of
64 bytes, so TLS and DTLS pad out messages with remaining space.</p>

<p>After subtracting 8 bytes for the length field and 1 byte of mandatory
padding, we are left with a maximum message length of 55 bytes that
can be encoded within one block.  This means that messages less than
55 bytes can be processed with only four compression function
evaluations, and that in general the number of compressions is equal
to</p>

<p>$$\left\lceil\frac{L-55}{64}\right\rceil+4$$</p>

<p>for messages of <em>L</em> bytes.  The compression function is relatively expensive, so the difference between 4 and 5 iterations is distinguishable in good conditions.  It is also possible to submit multiple requests as described below to amplify the differences if necessary.</p>

<p>The authors detail first a distinguishing attack, and then a variation allowing for full plaintext recovery.  All attacks rely on the timing channel.  Specifically, the authors describe in detail how it is possible to place a target ciphertext block at the end of an encrypted record, causing the decryption function to interpret the plaintext block corresponding to the ciphertext block as padding.  Thus the amount of time required to process that block depends on plaintext bytes, leaking information.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Through these readings and their respective explanations, we see that
cryptographic protocols are often broken and need to be patched. There
is always some threat model out there looking to exploit the first
sign of weakness to decrypt and listen in on what should be a secure,
encrypted channel. Through this last week, we focused on looking at
padding oracle attacks which take advantage of the padding on the
respective blocks in a CBC chain as they are passed from operation to
operation. With the last word oracle and the BEAST attack, we saw how
important this padding was to the security of the whole
operation. With our look at Lucky 13, we were able to see that people
were able to exploit the fact that one extra compression had to be
done in certain situations to glean information about the message. As
such, we see just from the padding, we have so many attacks.</p>

<p>There are so many aspects to SSL/TLS protocols that so many more
exploits exist. So, what are ways that we can prevent these attacks?
With the padding attacks, we saw that they tried standardizing error
messages (but, why not just encrypt the message and send it
back?). Should our strategy just be to move as quickly to the newest
version of the security protocols? Should we add the MAC to the
messages after encryption?</p>

<p>TLS 1.3 (the most recent release) has been drafted (and in the process
of release) and has resolved many of these issues that have exploited
weaknesses present in older versions of the protocol. However, its
adoption rate has been very low and so it is important to bring this
up as more and more operations should be moved over to TLS 1.3, as
this seems to be the most secure system we have available right now
and thus should be adopted.</p>
