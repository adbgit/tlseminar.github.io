## Anti-Downgrade Prevention and Detection

TLS 1.2 suffers from various downgrade and man-in-the-middle attacks like Logjam, FREAK and POODLE.
Logjam exploits the option of using legacy "export-grade" 512-bit Diffieâ€“Hellman groups in TLS 1.2. It forces susceptible servers to downgrade to cryptographically weak 512 bit Diffie-Hellman groups, which could then be compromised.
FREAK is a man-in-the-middle attack that affects the OpenSSL stack, the default Android web browser, and some Safari browsers. It tricks servers into negotiating a TLS connection using cryptographically weak 512 bit encryption keys.
POODLE exploits vulnerability in SSL 3.0 but is applicable to TLS 1.2 after the attacker performs version rollback to SSL 3.0 through a man-in-the-middle attack.
