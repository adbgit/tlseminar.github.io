I hope everyone is enjoying Spring Break!

You can see the results of the survey here: [Mid-Course Survey
Results](/docs/mid-course-survey.pdf) (I edited one response that
mentioned another student since that wasn't intended to be public, but
otherwise it is everything that was submitted.)

Based on the survey responses, and the depletion of Team Poppyseed, I
have made some adjustments to the teams and schedule.  Team Sesame,
Team Cinnamon, and Team Poppyseed have been turned into a Smoked
Salmon Shmear, and reformed as Team Pineapple (which is Team Sesame
and some additions from Poppyseed) and Team Mango.  Teams should
wrap-up their remaining blogging responsibilities as they were (that
is, Team Poppyseed is still responsible for completing the blog for
Class 7, which hopefully is well underway already).

I don't want to increase the presentation and blogging workload for
the rest of the semester, though, especially since I want to ensure
everyone has time to work on your project.  So, each team will still
be leading every third week, and blogging every third week, and we
will do something else in the other classes.

Team Mango is scheduled to lead the next class on March 17 (this is
what was assigned to Team Cinnamon, so not a new responsibility for
most of the team, and the new recruits from Team Poppyseed should have
limited roles expected for this first presentation since they just
joined the reformulated team).  Team Pineapple is responsible for
Blogging and Food for the class.  Note that according to the survey
results, 73.4% of the class is sick of bagels.  So, Team Pineapple is
challenged to come up with something more interesting for breakfast.

The full revised schedule is below.  Note that the team that is not
leading the class is responsible for both Blogging and Food.
