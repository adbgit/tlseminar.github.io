See [Schedule](/schedule) for the schedule of class topics and team responsibilities.

# Responsibilities

For each week (except for project proposal and presentation weeks),
one team will be responsible for Leading the class, one team for
writing a Blog post on the class topic, and one team for arranging
food. 

**Leading Team.**  The team responsible for leading a class should:

- Two weeks before the scheduled class, meet briefly with the coordinator(s) to discuss plan for the class.
- One week before the scheduled class, go over detailed plan for class with coordinator.
- No later than one week before class: send out to the class Slack group the preparation materials for the class.  This can include links to papers to read, but could also include exercises to do or software to install and experiment with, etc.
- Day of class: lead an interesting, engaging, and illuminating class!
- After class: help the Blogging team by providing them with your materials, answering their questions, and reviewing their write-up.

**Blogging Team.** The team responsible for blogging a class should:

- The week before the scheduled class, do the preparation work posted by the lead team.
- The week before the scheduled class, develop a team plan for how to manage the blogging.
- During class, participate actively in the class, and take detailed notes (this can be distributed among the team).
- By the Tuesday following class, have a draft of the blog post ready, and share it with the rest of the class (including the leading team and coordinators) for comments.
- By the next Friday (one week after the class), have a final version of the blog post ready to add to the course site.

**Food Team.** The team responsible for food should:

- The week before the scheduled class, do the preparation work posted by the lead team.
- Plan among yourselves what food to bring and who is responsible.  If
  you want to use my credit card to buy food, borrow it.
- Bring something yummy, but not too messy or disruptive, to class.
- Save the receipts to get reimbursed, and take care of the
  reimbursement. (This is easiest if the reimbursee is someone already
  set up in the CS department's financial system.)
