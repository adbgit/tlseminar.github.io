<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>In 2009, Jeff Moser published <a href="http://www.moserware.com/2009/06/first-few-milliseconds-of-https.html">an excellent article</a> on the first few milliseconds of an HTTP request. It described in detail how TLS 1.0 connections are established, including a great description of RSA. We&rsquo;ve attempted to build and adapt upon that article here by describing how the process works for a TLS 1.2 connection. As of January 2nd 2017, TLS 1.2 has roughly <a href="https://www.trustworthyinternet.org/ssl-pulse/">83.2% adoption</a> among top websites, so now is a great time to dive in.</p>

<p>The process of conecting via TLS 1.2 begins when the user attempts to navigate to a website. For this description, we are attempting to navigate to <a href="https://example.com/">https://example.com/</a></p>

<h2 id="tls-layers">TLS Layers</h2>

<p>The TLS protocol is composed of several layers, which come together to form each request. Here are descriptions of the common layers</p>

<p><img src="/images/firstfew/gnutls-layers.png" alt="tls layers" /></p>

<p><strong>Transport Layer</strong> - The protocol over which TLS data is distributed. For HTTPS, this will be TCP. Needs only to be reliable (packet loss must be handled). Not a direct part of TLS.</p>

<p><strong>Record Layer</strong> - The record layer handles sending/receiving TLS messages, including data fragmentation for packets, (optional and bad) compression, and encryption.</p>

<p>The next three are common protocols that operate within the body of the Record Layer. TLS extensions can specify additional protocols.</p>

<p><strong>Handshake Protocol</strong> - Responsible for choosing a cipher suite, connection parameters, and coordinating a shared secret.</p>

<p><strong>Alert Procotol</strong> - Used to communicate warnings and errors. The most common alerts are for an invalid server certificate or to signal the end of a TLS connection when the client exits.</p>

<p><strong>Application Protocol</strong> - Raw higher-level application data transmitted by TLS. For us, this is HTTP.</p>

<p>Now, onto the first few milliseconds of a TLSv1.2 request!</p>

<h2 id="part-0-the-record-layer">Part 0: The Record Layer</h2>

<p>Since the following packets will be wrapped in a Record Layer struct, it&rsquo;s worth describing that here.</p>

<p><img src="/images/firstfew/record-layer.png" alt="record layer struct" /></p>

<p>The record packet specifies the Content Type of the request, the TLS version, data length, and then the content data (in this image, a handshake clienthello).</p>

<p>Note that the version specified in the record layer is often different from that specified in the handshake. This is for compatibility with some old TLS/SSL servers. You will often see the version here specified as TLS 1.0 (0x0103, or SSL 3.0)</p>

<h2 id="part-1-client-hello">Part 1: Client Hello</h2>

<p>Our web browser (Microsoft Edge 38.14393.0.0 on Windows 10) will begin the TLS 1.2 handshake with a ClientHello record.</p>

<p><img src="/images/firstfew/client-hello.png" alt="clienthello record" /></p>

<p>We can see several important fields here worth mentioning. First, the <strong>time</strong> (GMT seconds since midnight Jan 1, 1970) and <strong>random</strong> bytes are included. This will be used later in the protocol to generate our symmetric encryption key.</p>

<p>The client can send an optional <strong>session ID</strong> (not sent in this case) to quickly resume a previous TLS connection and skip portions of the TLS handshake.</p>

<p>Arguably the most important part of the ClientHello message is the list of <strong>cipher suites</strong>, which dictate the key exchange algorithm, bulk encryption algorithm (with key length), MAC, and a psuedo-random function. The list should be ordered by client preference. The collection of these choices is a &ldquo;cipher suite&rdquo;, and the server is responsible for choosing a secure one it supports, or return an error if it doesn&rsquo;t support any.</p>

<p>The final field specified in the specification is for <strong>compression methods</strong>. However, secure clients will advertise that they do not support compression (by passing &ldquo;null&rdquo; as the only algorithm) to avoid the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME_(security_exploit)">CRIME attack</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, the ClientHello can have a number of different extensions. A common one is <strong>server_name</strong>, which specifies the hostname the connection is meant for, so webservers hosting multiple sites can present the correct certificate.</p>

<h2 id="server-hello">Server Hello</h2>

<p>Once the server has processed our ClientHello, it will respond with a TLSv1.2 ServerHello message</p>

<p><img src="/images/firstfew/server-hello.png" alt="serverhello message" /></p>

<p>This message returns several important fields, beginning with the TLS <strong>version</strong> to be used, usually the highest version supported by both client and server. It also includes the server <strong>time</strong> (not sure why example.com is so off!) and 28 <strong>random bytes</strong> for use later.</p>

<p>The server also makes a <strong>cipher suite selection</strong> from the list chosen by the client. This should be the strongest suite supported by both. In our case, the server has chosen TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, indicating the following:
* Key Exchange: Elliptic curve diffie-hellman, signed with RSA
* Encryption: AES in GCM mode with 128 bit keys
* MAC: SHA256</p>

<h2 id="certificate">Certificate</h2>

<p>After the ServerHello, the server will send a certificate chain to the client if applicable.</p>

<p><img src="/images/firstfew/server-certificate.png" alt="server certificate message" /></p>

<p>Each certificate comes with information about domains it supports, who it was issued by, and the time period (start and end) of its validity.</p>

<p>The certificate chain is a list of certificates beginning with the TLS certificate for the current domain, and ending in a root certificate that is built-in to the web browser. Each certificate is signed by the certificate above it in the chain, and it is this chain that the client validates to verify the server.</p>

<p>In our case, example.com has a certificate issued by &ldquo;DigiCert SHA2 High Assurance&rdquo;, which in turn is issued by the root certificate &ldquo;DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA.&rdquo; On Windows, you can view the list of root certificates on your system with <code>certmgr.msc</code></p>

<p><img src="/images/firstfew/certmgr.png" alt="certmgr" /></p>

<p>We can see the DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA in our store, along with several other DigiCert certificates. OSX allows you to see root certificates using the &ldquo;Keychain Access&rdquo; program, where they are listed under &ldquo;System Roots&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="/images/firstfew/keychain-access.png" alt="osx keychain access" /></p>

<p>In general, browsers will defer to the operating system root certificates as the central store for their validation. One notable exception is Firefox, which uses its own certificate store and ignores system root certificates by default.</p>

<p>Root CA certificates are implicitly trusted by every system they&rsquo;re included on. An attacker who manages to control their private key could impersonate any website without raising any red flags, so it&rsquo;s important that the certificate authorities keep them safe (<a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/dev-security-policy@lists.mozilla.org/msg05455.html">but that doesn&rsquo;t always happen</a>).</p>

<h2 id="optional-certificate-status-ocsp">Optional: Certificate Status (OCSP)</h2>

<p>One increasingly common extension is the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), used for certificate revocations. OCSP servers can be consulted by clients to check if the server certificate has been revoked, which helps solve a critical problem with TLS certificates. Servers response to certificate requests by issuing a signed response from the CA with a status code indicating whether or not the certificate is valid.</p>

<p>Prior to wide deployment of OCSP, TLS vendors shipped certificate revocation lists (CRLs) that contained serial numbers of revoked certificates.</p>

<p>To reduce load, servers often cache the OCSP response and send it as a Certificate Status TLS message (OCSP stapling). This helps reduce load on the OCSP system and protects attackers from analyzing OCSP requests to determine client browsing habits. The server will send this cached message in response to a <strong>status_request</strong> extension in the ClientHello message.</p>

<p><img src="/images/firstfew/ocsp-stapling.png" alt="ocsp stapling" /></p>

<p>Each OCSP ticket is signed by a trusted OCSP server. The response itself consists of a <strong>responseStatus</strong> and optional <strong>responseBytes</strong> with additional information.</p>

<p><img src="/images/firstfew/ocsp-response.png" alt="ocsp response info" /></p>

<p>In our case, the OCSP ticket is valid and cached for 7 days (1/20 to 1/27). The server itself is responsible for refreshing its OCSP ticket at that time.</p>

<h2 id="serverkeyexchange">ServerKeyExchange</h2>

<p>For DHE key-exchanges (DHE_DSS, DHE_RSA, and DH_anon), the server will use a ServerKeyExchange message to specify the parameters for the algorithm.</p>

<p><img src="/images/firstfew/dhe-params.png" alt="dhe parameters" /></p>

<p>The server has specified a <strong>named_curve</strong> curve type using the <strong>secp256r1</strong> elliptic curve (also known as <strong>P-256</strong> or <strong>prime256v1</strong>). This is a public <a href="http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf">NIST standard curve</a>. With knowledge of the curve to be used, both the server and client will know the crucial $p$ and $G$ values for ECDHE. For secp256r1, these are defined by NIST as:</p>

<pre><code>p = FFFFFFFF 00000001 00000000 00000000 00000000 FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF

G = 03 6B17D1F2 E12C4247 F8BCE6E5 63A440F2 77037D81 2DEB33A0 F4A13945 D898C296
</code></pre>

<p>The server will choose a random private key and compute $a*G$ as its <strong>public key</strong>. In addition to this it also signs the data with its private key - signing <code>SHA256(client_random + server_random + server_params)</code></p>

<h2 id="server-hello-done">Server Hello Done</h2>

<p><img src="/images/firstfew/server-hello-done.png" alt="serverhellodone" /></p>

<p>This short message from the server tells the client it&rsquo;s done sending information. Nothing more.</p>

<h2 id="clientkeyexchange">ClientKeyExchange</h2>

<p>Now, the client must  send its own ephemeral public key (for DH).</p>

<p><img src="/images/firstfew/client-dhe-key.png" alt="client dhe key" /></p>

<p>This is calculated by generating a random private key $b$ and from there calculating $b*G$ as its public key.</p>

<h2 id="completing-the-key-exchange">Completing the Key Exchange</h2>

<p>Now that the client has $a*G$ and the server $b*G$, both can calculate the final secret value $a*b*G$ with their own private keys. This is known as the <strong>pre-master secret</strong>. The key detail here is that calculating $a*b*G$ from $a*G$ and $b*G$ alone is computationally difficult.</p>

<p>We just have one final step to convert our pre-master secret into the final <strong>master secret</strong>. We will use the random bytes generated by the client and server earlier along with our chosen psuedo-random function. For us, that was SHA-256.</p>

<pre><code>master_secret = PRF(pre_master_secret, &quot;master secret&quot;, client_random + server_random)[0..47]
</code></pre>

<p>The TLS 1.2 spec defines the PRF as <code>PRF(secret, label, seed)</code> which expands to <code>P_SHA256(secret, label + seed)</code>. The label is the literal ASCII string &ldquo;master secret&rdquo; without any null terminator. This expands to the following definition:</p>

<pre><code>P_sha256(secret, seed) = HMAC_sha256(secret, A(1) + seed) +
                         HMAC_sha256(secret, A(2) + seed) +
                         HMAC_sha256(secret, A(3) + seed) +
                         ...
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>A(x)</code> is defined recursively as</p>

<pre><code>A(0) = seed
A(x) = HMAC_sha256(secret, A(x-1))
</code></pre>

<p>The result of the PRF is the final key that will be used for the bulk of the crypto in our application. We only want 48 bytes here, so we would need 2 rounds of SHA-256 and would discard the extra data.</p>

<h2 id="client-changecipherspec">Client ChangeCipherSpec</h2>

<p>The final unencrypted message sent by the client will be a ChangeCipherSpec message, which indicates that all following messages will be encrypted.</p>

<p><img src="/images/firstfew/change-cipher-spec.png" alt="changecipherspec message" /></p>

<h2 id="client-finished-server-changecipherspec-and-server-finished">Client Finished, Server ChangeCipherSpec, and Server Finished</h2>

<p>Immediately after sending a ChangeCipherSpec message, the client will send an encrypted Handshake Finished message to ensure the server is able to understand the agreed-upon encryption. The message will contain a <strong>hash of all previous handshake messages</strong>, along with the string &ldquo;client finished&rdquo;. This is very important because it verifies that no part of the handshake has been tampered with by an attacker. It also includes the random bytes that were sent by the client and server, protecting it from replay attacks where the attacker pretends to be one of the parties.</p>

<p>Once received by the server, the server will acknowledge with its own ChangeCipherSpec message, followed immediately by its own Finished message verifying the contents of the handshake.</p>

<p>Note: if you have been following along in Wireshark, there appears to be a bug with Client/Server Finish messages when using AES_GCM that mislabels them.</p>

<h2 id="application-data">Application Data</h2>

<p>Finally, we can begin to transmit encrypted data! It may seem like a lot of work, but that is soon to pay off. The only remaining step is to discuss how the data is encrypted with AES_GCM, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption">AEAD</a> cipher.</p>

<p>First, we generate a MAC, key, and IV for both the client and the server using our master secret and the PRF definition from earlier.</p>

<pre><code>key_data = PRF(master_secret, &quot;key expansion&quot;, server_random + client_random);
</code></pre>

<p>Since we are using 128-bit AES with SHA-256, we&rsquo;ll pull out the following key data:</p>

<pre><code>// client_write_MAC_key = key_data[0..31]
// server_write_MAC_key = key_data[32..63]
client_write_key = key_data[64..79]
server_write_key = key_data[80..95]
client_write_IV = key_data[96..99]
server_write_IV = key_data[100..103]
</code></pre>

<p>For AEAD ciphers like GCM, we don&rsquo;t need the MAC keys, but we offset them anyways. The client and server also get different keys to prevent a replay attack where a client message it looped back to it.</p>

<p>We also construct <code>additional_data</code> and an 8-byte <code>nonce</code>, both of which are sent with the encrypted data. In the past, it was thought that the nonce could be either random or just a simple session counter. However, <a href="https://github.com/nonce-disrespect/nonce-disrespect">recent research</a> found many sites using random nonces for AES_GCM were vulnerable to nonce reuse attacks, so it&rsquo;s best to just use an incrementing counter tied to the session.</p>

<pre><code>additional_data = sequence_num + record_type + tls_version + length
nonce = &lt;random_8_bytes&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we can encrypt our data with AES GCM!</p>

<pre><code>encrypted = AES_GCM(client_write_key, client_write_IV+nonce, &lt;DATA&gt;, additional_data)
</code></pre>

<p>and the server can read it with</p>

<pre><code>&lt;DATA&gt; = AES_GCM(client_write_key, client_write_IV+nonce, encrypted, additional_data)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p><img src="/images/firstfew/tls-hs-ecdhe.png" alt="tls 1.2 ecdhe handshake" />
(source: <a href="https://timtaubert.de/blog/2015/11/more-privacy-less-latency-improved-handshakes-in-tls-13/">More Privacy, Less Latency: Improved Handshakes in TLS version 1.3</a>)</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all it takes to make a TLS 1.2 connection! Over the course of ~103ms, we established a bidirectional encrypted tunnel and sent a full HTTP request and response in only 2 round trips. Although we didn&rsquo;t cover nearly everything in the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246">full TLS 1.2 RFC</a>, we hope you have a pretty good overview of how process functions - and how much work goes in behind the scenes to secure web traffic!</p>

  <p class="fronthead"><A href="/blogging/">Blogging Mechanics</a><br><span class="authordate">David Evans, Sun, 22 Jan 2017</span></p>
    <p>Here are some suggestions for how to create the class blog posts for
your assigned classes.  I believe each team has at least a few members
with enough experience using git and web contruction tools that
following these instructions won&rsquo;t be a big burden, but if you have
other ways you want to build your blog page for a topic let me know
and we can discuss alternative options.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Install <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.  Hugo is a static website
generator that builds a site from Markdown pages.  (With homebrew on
Mac OS X, this is easy: <code>brew update &amp;&amp; brew install hugo</code>.)</p></li>

<li><p>Clone the github repository,
<a href="https://github.com/tlseminar/tlseminar.github.io"><em>https://github.com/tlseminar/tlseminar.github.io</em></a>.
This is what is used to build the
<a href="https://tlseminar.github.io">tlseminar.github.io</a> site.  If you are
working with multiple teammates on the blog post (which you probably
should be), you can add write permissions for everyone to the cloned
repository.</p></li>

<li><p>You should create your page in the <code>web/content/post/</code>
subdirectory. You can start by copying an earlier file in that
directory (e.g., <code>class1.md</code>) and updating the header section
(between the <code>+++</code> marks) and replacing everything after that with
your content.  Don&rsquo;t forget to update the date so your page will
appear in the right order.</p></li>

<li><p>You can use multiple files (but probably only one in
the <code>post/</code> directory (this will show up as pages on the front
list).  Use the <code>web/content/images</code> directory for images and the
<code>web/content/docs</code> directory for papers.  Using images and other
resources to make your post interesting and visually compelling is
highly encouraged!</p></li>

<li><p>Write the blog page using Markdown.  Markdown is a simple markup
language that can be used to easily generate both HTML and other
output document formats.  You can probably figure out everything you
need by looking at previous posts, but for a summary of Markdown,
see <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown: Syntax</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>To test the post, run <code>make develop</code> (in the <code>web/</code> subdirectory of
your repository).  This starts the Hugo development server, usually
on port 1313 (unless that port is already in use).  Then, you can
view the site with a browser at <code>localhost:1313</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>When you are ready, submit a pull request to incorporate your
changes into the main repository (and public course website).  At
this stage, I will probably make things visible on the public site,
although it can still be edited and improved with subsequent
comments.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some suggestions for getting the necessary background for the
seminar.</p>

<h2 id="cryptography">Cryptography</h2>

<p>If you have already taken a cryptography course, you should have
enough cryptography background already.  If not, here are some
suggested ways to get enough crypo background over winter break to be
ready for the seminar.  I believe that for most students, the best way
to get the expected background for this course is to take my Applied
Cryptography course (more info below), but there are many options, and
lots of great resources that go into much more depth than my course if
you have more time.</p>

<h3 id="on-line-courses">On-Line Courses</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/applied-cryptography--cs387"><strong>Udacity cs387: Applied
Cryptography</strong></a>
- this is an open on-line course that you can take anytime taught by
myself (so I am somewhat partial to it!).  There are <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/courses/cs387/">some additional
materials for the course
available</a>,
including <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/courses/crypto-notes.pdf">extensive course notes
(PDF)</a>
created by Daniel Winter.  This is a very short and informal
introduction to cryptography, which would be enough background to be
prepared for the seminar.  (I can&rsquo;t give an unbiased assessment of the
course, but according to Information Week, it is a recommended course
to <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/strategic-cio/team-building-and-staffing/5-online-classes-to-pump-up-it-careers/d/d-id/898915"><em>&ldquo;Pump Up IT
Careers&rdquo;</em></a>,
and <a href="www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/online-universities-udacity-grand-challenge-david-stavens-dave-evans">Prospect
Magazine</a>
claimed the instructor has a &ldquo;Monty Python humor&rdquo; and &ldquo;cult
following&rdquo;, although you shouldn&rsquo;t believe everything you read in
British magazines.)</p>

<p>Dan Boneh&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto"><strong>Cryptography
Course</strong></a> (offered through
Coursera).  The materials from previous courses are not available
(although you may be able to find them if you are resourceful), so you
have to take the course when it is offered by Coursera. There is a
session starting December 26.  This is an excellent course that is a
bit longer and goes into more depth on many topics than my course.
You can read <a href="http://bryanpendleton.blogspot.com/2012/05/comparing-coursera-and-udacity.html">Bryan Pendleton&rsquo;s more objective
comparison</a>.</p>

<p>Christoff Parr and Jan Pelzl&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.crypto-textbook.com/"><strong>Understanding
Cryptography</strong></a> textbook includes
Parr&rsquo;s excellent <a href="http://wiki.crypto.rub.de/Buch/movies.php">video
lectures</a> (chalkboard
style without editing, so takes some patience to watch).</p>

<h3 id="textbooks">Textbooks</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.crypto101.io/">Crypto 101</a> - a very easy to read and
practically-focused introduction to cryptography (available as a <a href="/docs/Crypto101.pdf">free,
creative-commons licensed PDF</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/imc.html"><em>Introduction to Modern
Cryptography</em></a>, Jonathan Katz
and Yehuda Lindell.  This provides a lot more depth that is required
for joining the seminar, but is an excellent book for ambitious
students with more time.</p>

<h2 id="computing-systems">Computing Systems</h2>

<p>Students in the class will benefit from understanding computing
systems and having experience with systems-level programming at least
at the level of a typical introductory operating systems course.
Students without this experience will either need to put a lot of
effort into learning it, or select projects and presentation topics
that focus on other aspects.</p>

<p>Some resources for learning about computing systems are below.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ops-class.org/">&ldquo;Hack the Kernel&rdquo;</a> - Operating Systems
class developed by <a href="https://www.bluegroup.systems/people/gwa/">Geoffrey
Challen</a>.  Provides
programming assignments you can try on your own, as well as video
lectures and lots of on-line materials.</p>

<p><a href="http://rust-class.org/">cs4414: Operating Systems</a> - Operating
systems course I taught in Fall 2013 and Spring 2014. Includes
<a href="http://rust-class.org/pages/classes.html">videos</a> of lectures, and
programming assignments in Rust (some of which will need some updating
to work in the latest version of Rust).</p>

<p>CMU&rsquo;s <a href="http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/">Computing Systems</a> course and
textbook by Randal Bryant and David O&rsquo;Hallaron provides an excellent
introduction to systems programming, as well as a series of <a href="http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/labs.html">fun
self-study labs</a>.</p>

<h3 id="rust-programming">Rust Programming</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping several of the projects will involve contribution to open
source projects using Rust to provide secure, efficient, and
iter-operable implementations of TLS and other cryptographic
functionalities.  It is not a requirement that you use Rust in this
class, but everyone will be encouraged to get some experience with it.</p>

<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/"><strong>Rust Programming Language
Book</strong></a> (this is the
&ldquo;official&rdquo; Rust book, which includes a tutorial to get started)</p>

<p><a href="http://aml3.github.io/RustTutorial/"><strong>Rust Tutorial</strong></a> (this was
developed for my <a href="https://rust-class.org/">cs4414 class</a> by Alex
Lamana, Rob Michaels, and Wil Thomason.  (Some parts may need updating
to latest version of Rust, so if you go through this, please submit
updates as pull requests!)</p>
